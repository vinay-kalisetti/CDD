SDLC:
===============
-> A life cycle simply describes the methods we use to make a software product through its stages.
-> It usually maps out various activites performed on a software product from start to end.
-> when a product is developing, It is important to have a clear understanding between about the steps and methods to be followed.
-> Stages in SDLC:
    Requirement analysis->Defining->Designing->	coding->Testing->Deployment->Maintanence


AGILE:
==================
-> It is an iterative approach to software developement.
-> Generally it takes short period of time to make minor changes by delivering faster.
-> It takes feedback at the end of each iteration until the final product is made successfully.
-> By using agile methodology, continous delivery and development is possible.
-> Here, we can get the clear understanding of requirements and can be changed later.
-> In agile, the product development is divided and performed in the form of sprints.
-> Agile primarily has two central units:
				1. Release
				2. Iteration
-> Here, The project gets divided into flexible and transperent iterations.

Disadvantages:
-----------------
1. The estimation of cost may get difficult due to constant iteration.
2. Version controlling is not possible here.
3. The development team should be hihly professional.

Agile Tools:
-----------------
1. JIRA
2. ClickUp
3. GitHub
4. LeanKit
5. Planbox


DevOps:
====================
-> DevOps is a combination of two words : Development & Operations, where a single team can handle the entire application life cycle.
-> With the help of DevOps, Quality & Speed of application delivery has improved to a great extent.
-> DevOps architecture features:
			1. Automation
			2. Collaboration
			3. Integration
			4. Configuration Management
-> It responds faster to market changes and improve business growth.
